            <h3>Increased visibility & impact</h3>
            <p>
              Student's work will be openly accessible to researchers around the
              world and showcased alongside other members of the Penn community.
              OA works are known to receive more citations and greater impact.

            <h3>Permanent links</h3>
            <p>
              ScholarlyCommons provides permanent URLs (no dead links!) for each
              work, meaning students can reliably link to their project on
              resumes, websites, etc.

            <h3>"Proof" of scholarly discovery</h3>
            <p>
              Having your work online serves as a time-stamped indication of
              your claim to a scholarly idea, reducing likelihood of getting
              "scooped".

            <h3>Participation in showcase of DNP scholarship</h3>
            <p>
              Participation in the collection demonstrates quality of work and
              sits alongside other scholars who have graduated from the DNP
              program.

            <h3>Requires slightly more overhead when publishing</h3>
            <p>
              Some publishers may not accept work that has been posted on a
              preprint server or IR. Students should look into publisher
              policies related to preprint sharing prior to submission, or
              embargo work for 1-3 years.
            </p>

            <h3>Some students prefer privacy</h3>
            <p>
              There are some students who prefer to not distribute their work
              publicly for one reason or another. This sentiment varies from
              discipline to discipline. Having a flexible posting policy -- with
              opt-ins or embargoes -- is a good idea if this is a concern.
