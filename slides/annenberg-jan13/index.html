              The ARL endorsed definition is relatively dry. It's true, but I
              find the "digital use and reuse of scholarsip" unsatisfying.

              A not-quite-pin-downable collection of skills, methods, and
              approaches for answering scholarly questions using digital
              technology, often involving community building.

                  I like this defintion that I made up better. It gets at the
                  fluidity of this field and it's relatively amorphous
                  qualities.

                  Micah Vandegrift said that "Generally digital scholarship
                  resists attempts to be corralled into any one field, thereby
                  serving as a bridge across disciplinary divides. It's hard to
                  pin down and has so many different permutations across
                  organizations." That's true, and you see it in the variety of
                  services, specialities, and focuses for different groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I also like this definition because it reveals a bit about the
                  human element of all of this -- that it's about collaboration,
                  about building a community of researchers and practioners, and
                  how we often share the outputs of our work very broadly and
                  publicly.

            <h3>What are the most common methods in DS right now?</h3>
            <aside class="notes">
              The methods that we commonly see under the umbrella of digital
              scholarship include some of the following (and I'm going to
              provide some examples because those make things more interesting).
              It should be obvious that not every DS unit is going to specialize
              in every single one of these. Universities should focus on the
              areas of strength and where their abilities are greatest.

              Geographic information systems (GIS) is the combination of tabular
              data (e.g. a spreadsheet) with geographic boundaries (e.g.
              maps).There are all kinds of examples, but a couple that I want to
              highlight.

            Data Curation & Database Design

                <li>
                  Data curation is the organization and integration of data
                  collected from various sources. This work involves annotation,
                  publication and presentation of the data such that the value
                  of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains
                  available for reuse and preservation. In other words, digital
                  curation is stewardship that provides for the reproducibility
                  and re-use of authentic digital data and other digital assets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Again, I'm turning towards another Penn Libraries DS project,
                  Data Refuge, which exemplifies this part of data stewardship
                  and reproducibility.

              John Ashbery’s Nest is a website and virtual tour of the American
              poet’s home. Makes use of virtual reality technologies to explore
              rooms and interact with objects inside the house, Nest enables
              users to experience the intimacy of being in “the middle of
              things,” a reality that echoes in Ashbery’s greatest poems. This
              was produced by the DHLab at Yale, which isn't technically part of
              Yale DS (at least I don't believe), but with so many of DS'
              methods, the intersectons and dotted-lines are sometimes areas of
              strength and are often overlapping with the work of Digital
              Scholarship in significant ways.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  At the top is the highly-collaborative, longer term projects.

                <li>
                  In the middle is the bread and butter type of stuff
                  (consultations, workshops, email correspondence).

                <li>

                  collections or an out of the box Omeka site).

              can still be a lot to wrap your head around.How do you focus on a

              development or other forms of customization. The challenge is
              using the resources and skills at our disposal to provide

              Projects are the most high profile type of work that DS -- and
              it's a field that will always have a heavy tendency to embrace
              projects -- but orientation towards providing routine services.

              So, this leads me to thinking about the future of DS. I'm not
              great at prognosticating the future, but I think that all of these
              common features serve as foundation underpinning what is to come
              and influences my thinking. I also want to focus on what I think
              _could_ be the future here at Penn, as opposed to the future more
              generally.

            Entrenched presence across university
            <aside class="notes">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Normalize and entrench the presence of DS in the university.
                  There's a recommendation to institute a center. Facilities
                  create presence; space matters). Focus on interactive spaces
                  where students, faculty, and others are encouraged to
                  physically connect around technology and tools. The idea is to
                  normalize the digital scholarship department/center as a
                  location where people can come for big collaborative projects,
                  small one-of helping things, and ongoing regular series of
                  workshops on popular topics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Caveat here is that a center can silo off activity (center
                  while also remaining somewhat de-centered). The downside is
                  that a distinct Center can be isolating, it puts the
                  activities of this group in a box distinct from the
                  traditional library activities. The future is where we have
                  entrench existing partnerships, established new dotted line
                  connections with liaisons in every discipline, and effectively
                  normalized the presence of DS in the univeristy through our
                  parnterships, services, and publications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I think the future also is one in which we more systmetically
                  integrate DS' outputs and infrastructure in the internal
                  workings of the Libraries. Essentially, stronger integration
                  between DS work and broader library system. For instance, how
                  do we include the outputs of digital scholarship in the
                  collection development activities of the libraries? How do we
                  meaningful preserve the outputs of these projects? Duture of
                  DS is an integreated approach to the outputs and maintenance
                  of these materials in the Library system.

            Community-building as increasingly significant activity of DS units
            <aside class="notes">
              I think there will be more and more focus on intentionality in
              community building. The idea that digital projects aren’t merely
              technical collaborations but social enterprises that engage whole
              communities around ideas, methodologies, and areas of study. I
              think it's also about creating a broader community of practice, of
              shared interests in technology and new technologies, of trying to
              create experiences and understanding that is current and expansive
              in all of the ways that technology affords (but also recognizing
              the materiality of life and the essential roles libraries play in
              a familiar sense). Hub of activity and learning for a broad array
              of people. I think public programming as well is important. What
              can we do to engage with the community of developers out there?
              What about the general public? That relates to my next thought.

            Still true to its defining features
            <aside class="notes">
              Building on #5, I think DS is going to continue to be a field that
              is platform-agnostic and prone towards experimentation (while
              still being entrenched in the system and no longer seen as "new").
              Set up structures and workflows that allow for experimentation and
              quick pilots. Don’t belabor the process through overly elaborate
              approval process. If a tool is going to be used, discuss the
              merits and red flags with the partner. Hold events to whet
              appetites and encourage understanding. If kernel of idea emerges,
              triage it. The process of pushing things down the pyramid of
              experimental to service to rote is essential to this work.
